# Panhandle

This is a project to address distribution of charitable donations to organizations that are capable of supporting persons experiencing homelessness.

## Running this app

In order to run this app, clone or download the repo, then:

```bash
npm install
```

To serve the app, you will need a .env file configuring the app for use on your system. Crucial pieces of this are the database connection, the server address. There are likely other ENV errors.
Hosting on Heroku, etc. should avoid this, as long as you configure the Heroku ENV appropriately with a database.
